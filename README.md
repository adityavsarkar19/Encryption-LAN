# Computer Networks Final Course Project (CS-1340)
There are two Encryption Algorithms we have implemented over LAN.
They are:
1. XOR Cipher
2. Caesar Cipher


How to Use:
1. Download/git clone the Repository

For XOR Cipher:
1. The system allows the user to either directly encrypt/decrypt text.
2. User can also directly encrypt/decrypt .txt files. "abc.txt" file is an example text file in the folder. 
3. NOTE: If no key/password is provided, the user's IP address is taken as DEFAULT KEY.
